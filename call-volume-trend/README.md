# ☎️ Call Volume Trend Analysis

This project analyzes inbound customer call data for an insurance company to optimize agent staffing and reduce the call abandonment rate. Using Excel, I explored call volume trends, calculated manpower needs, and recommended a scheduling strategy to reduce abandon rate from 30% to 10%.


## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze daily and hourly inbound call volume
- Determine average call durations by time bucket
- Calculate the number of agents needed per shift to meet SLAs
- Recommend manpower planning to reduce abandon rates


## 🧰 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables & Time Bucketing
- Agent capacity estimation formulas

|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Day Shift    | 1,06,189               | 8,168            |
| Night Shift  | 31,856                 | 2,450            |
| **Total**    | **1,38,045**           | **10,618**       |

- The highest agent demand occurs during **10 AM–12 PM** (over 1,000 agents).
- The night shift sees reduced demand but still needs over 2,400 agents for 90% SLA.
