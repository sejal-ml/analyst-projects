# 🚗 Car Feature Dataset Dashboard

This project explores a car specification dataset to uncover what features influence car pricing, popularity, and fuel efficiency. An interactive Excel dashboard was created using pivot tables, charts, and regression analysis.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Identify which features most affect MSRP (price)
- Compare pricing across transmission types, engine types, and body styles
- Analyze brand vs. feature impact (e.g., luxury vs. standard)
- Explore fuel efficiency across models and engines

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Formulas)
- Regression Analysis (Scatter plot + trendline)
- Data Cleaning using Excel formulas

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **City MPG** and **Engine Horsepower** are the top predictors of car price  
- **Automated Manual** and **Direct Drive** transmissions are found in premium models  
- **Diesel** and **Flex Fuel** engines are most common among high-selling cars  
- **Luxury brands** like Bugatti and Rolls-Royce show significantly higher MSRP  
- Cars with **fewer cylinders** have better fuel efficiency but lower power output
